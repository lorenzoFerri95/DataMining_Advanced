Project Task 2 - Advanced Classifiers and Evaluation

Using the dataset for classification prepared for Task 1 build several advanced classifiers able to predict room
occupancy from the available variables. In particular, you are required to use SVM (linear and non-linear)

Evaluate each classifier using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, ROC, etc; Draw your conclusion about the classifiers.
Highlight in the report different aspects typical of each classifier. For instance for SVM: is a linear model the
best way to shape the decision boundary?

You are NOT required to experiment also in the imbalanced case but if you do it is not considered a mistake.
