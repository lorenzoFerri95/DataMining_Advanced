Project Task 1 - Basic Classifiers and Evaluation

Prepare the dataset in order to build several basic classifiers able to predict room occupancy from the available variables.
You are welcome in creating new variables.

Analyze the value distribution of the class to predict and turn the dataset into
an imbalanced version reaching a strong majority-minority distribution (e.g. 96%-4%).
Then solve again the classification task adopting the various techniques studied (or new ones).

Draw your conclusions about the basic classifiers and techniques adopted in this analysis.
