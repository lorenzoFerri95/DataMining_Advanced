Project Task 1 - Basic Classifiers and Evaluation

Prepare the dataset in order to build several basic classifiers able to predict room occupancy from the available variables.
You are welcome in creating new variables.

Solve the classification task with k-NN (testing values of k), Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression,
Decision Tree using cross-validation and/or random/grid search for parameter estimation.

Select two continuous attributes, define a regression problem and try to solve it using
different techniques reporting various evaluation measures. Plot the two-dimensional dataset.
Then generalize to multiple linear regression and observe how the performance varies.

Evaluate each classifier using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, ROC, AUC and Lift Chart.

Draw your conclusions about the basic classifiers and techniques adopted in this analysis.
