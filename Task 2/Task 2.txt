Project Task 2 - Advanced Classifiers and Evaluation

Using the dataset for classification prepared for Task 1 build several advanced classifiers able to predict room
occupancy from the available variables. In particular, you are required to use SVM (linear and non-linear),
NN (Single and Multilayer Perceptron), DNN (design at least two different architectures),
Ensemble Classifier (RandomForest, AdaBoost and a Bagging technique in which you can select a base classifier
of your choice with a justification).

Evaluate each classifier using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, ROC, etc; Draw your conclusion about the classifiers.
Highlight in the report different aspects typical of each classifier. For instance for SVM: is a linear model the
best way to shape the decision boundary? Or for NN: what are the parameter sets or the convergence criteria
suggesting you are avoiding overfitting? How many iterations/base classifiers are needed to allow a good estimation
using an ensemble method? Which is the feature importance for the Random Forest?

You are NOT required to experiment also in the imbalanced case but if you do it is not considered a mistake.
