Project Task 1 - Basic Classifiers and Evaluation

Prepare the dataset in order to build several basic classifiers able to predict room occupancy from the available variables.
You are welcome in creating new variables.

Solve the classification task with k-NN (testing values of k), Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression,
Decision Tree using cross-validation and/or random/grid search for parameter estimation.

Select two continuous attributes, define a regression problem and try to solve it using
different techniques reporting various evaluation measures. Plot the two-dimensional dataset.
Then generalize to multiple linear regression and observe how the performance varies.

Evaluate each classifier using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, ROC, AUC and Lift Chart.

--------------------------------

1- Try to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset using the methods studied (or new ones).
Test PCA and try to solve the classification task in two dimensions.
Plot the dataset in the two new dimensions and observe the decision boundary and the one of the trained algorithms.

2- Analyze the value distribution of the class to predict and turn the dataset into
an imbalanced version reaching a strong majority-minority distribution (e.g. 96%-4%).
Then solve again the classification task adopting the various techniques studied (or new ones).

Draw your conclusions about the basic classifiers and techniques adopted in this analysis.
