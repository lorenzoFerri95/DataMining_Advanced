Project Task 1 - Basic Classifiers and Evaluation

Prepare the dataset in order to build several basic classifiers able to predict room occupancy from the available variables.
You are welcome in creating new variables.

Try to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset using the methods studied (or new ones).
Test PCA and try to solve the classification task in two dimensions.
Plot the dataset in the two new dimensions and observe the decision boundary and the one of the trained algorithms.

Draw your conclusions about the basic classifiers and techniques adopted in this analysis.
