Project Task 2 - Advanced Classifiers and Evaluation

Using the dataset for classification prepared for Task 1 build several advanced classifiers able to predict room
occupancy from the available variables. In particular, you are required to use NN (Single and Multilayer Perceptron), 
DNN (design at least two different architectures)

Evaluate each classifier using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, ROC, etc; Draw your conclusion about the classifiers.
Highlight in the report different aspects typical of each classifier. For instance for for NN: what are the parameter sets or the convergence criteria
suggesting you are avoiding overfitting?
You are NOT required to experiment also in the imbalanced case but if you do it is not considered a mistake.
